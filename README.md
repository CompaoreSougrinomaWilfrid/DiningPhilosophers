# Dining Philosophers - Final Project

This repository contains the full implementation of the Dining Philosophers problem, completed as part of the course assignment.

## 🟩 Part 1: Akka (Scala)
- Uses Akka actors to simulate philosophers and forks
- Resource hierarchy strategy prevents deadlock
- Supports both local and remote execution
- Parametric: works with any number of philosophers

📁 See: [`akka/README.md`](./akka/README.md)

## 🟦 Part 2: P Language (Formal Verification)
- Implements two variants: deadlock-prone and deadlock-free
- Includes formal deadlock detection monitor
- Verified using P checker

📁 See: [`P_version/README.md`](./P_version/README.md)
